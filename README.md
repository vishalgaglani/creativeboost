The idea is based on [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16019229) 2005 study which concluded that subjects came up with more creative solutions to a brainstorming challenge, if they first had to focus on solving a puzzle for five minutes.

##Instructions

1. Think of your problem
2. Focus on solving as many anagrams as you can for 5 minutes
3. Try and relax... now write down the first couple things that come to your mind
